## Chatbot with Machine Learning and Python

This project demonstrates how to build a simple chatbot using machine learning techniques in Python. By leveraging a neural network trained on intents and patterns, this chatbot can handle basic user interactions in a conversational format. The model classifies incoming messages into intents, allowing the chatbot to respond accurately based on the userâ€™s input.

### Key Features
1. **Intent Recognition**: The chatbot is trained to recognize specific intents, allowing it to categorize user messages and provide relevant responses.
2. **Custom Dataset**: This chatbot uses a JSON dataset of intents, patterns, and responses. The dataset is structured to associate user intentions with a variety of possible responses.
3. **Tokenization and Preprocessing**: Text data is processed using tokenization and padded sequences, making it suitable for input into a neural network.
4. **Neural Network Model**: A Sequential neural network model is implemented with TensorFlow/Keras to classify user inputs by intent.
5. **Interactivity**: Once trained, the model can be interacted with directly, allowing for real-time conversation simulations.

### Model Training
The chatbot model is trained on a custom JSON dataset, where each intent includes sample phrases (patterns) and possible responses. Using this dataset, a neural network is trained to predict the intent of user input, enabling the chatbot to respond accurately.

### Technologies Used
- **Python** for programming the chatbot
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for building and training the neural network model
- **Scikit-Learn** for encoding intents and preprocessing text data
- **Colorama** for console color styling

### How It Works
1. **Data Preparation**: Intent categories and sample text patterns are prepared in a JSON file. These are tokenized and encoded to train the model.
2. **Model Training**: The model is trained to classify input sequences according to the intents.
3. **Chat Function**: After training, the chatbot reads user input, predicts the intent, and generates a response from predefined responses for that intent.

### Usage
Users can interact with the chatbot by typing messages, and the bot will respond based on the trained model. The conversation continues until the user chooses to exit.

This project serves as a beginner-friendly approach to understanding how chatbots work and is an excellent way to learn about machine learning in natural language processing (NLP).
